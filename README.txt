Written by: Anand Balaram 101217776

This readme will explain how to use the program.

This folder contains the source code files for the application as an IntelliJ project.
The "DDL.sql" and "DML.sql" files are used to create and insert the initial data into the database. These must be run before running the application.
The name of the database is COMP3005FinalProject.

The application code can be run through running the ManagementSystem.java file in the src folder.

The report can be found with the GitHub as well.

Below is a link to a video demonstrating the functionality of the code:
